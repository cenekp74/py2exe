    <h1>Convert python to exe online!</h1>
    <p>
        <b>py2exe.com</b> provides a simple way to convert python to exe online.
    </p>
    <p>
        To convert your project, please upload it below. You can upload a single <b>.py</b> script as well as a <b>zip</b> archive of multiple files. If you
        are uploading multiple files in zip, please name the main file "main.py" or "run.py" and make sure it is in the root of the zip file. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can give your exe a custom <b>icon</b> by putting it in a file called "icon.png" or "icon.ico" in the zip archive.
